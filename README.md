## Description

This has been an experiment to make something cool while getting more on top of
Typescript, Electron, HTML5 and Pixi.js. From that perspective, it has already
been a success.

It is playable on [https://nerdygentleman.itch.io/swipe-poker](itch.io) and
binaries can be purchased there.

## Building/Developing
